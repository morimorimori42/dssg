# Disassembly Sequence Structure Graphs (DSSG)

This repository shows a product created in 2024 for a small-scale university project to calculate the environmental impact (CO2e) for disassembly sequences of window components, based on literature like Smith et al. 2012. The environmental impact calculation is simplified, only to show that it is possible to link DSSG with such calculations and to compare different disassembly sequences based on CO2e emissions.

### Abstract

This study addresses the pressing need in the construction industry to develop methodologies that optimize the environ- mental impact of building end-of-life scenarios through systematic disassembly planning and accurate carbon footprint calculations. The research proposes a framework integrating Disassembly Sequence Structure Graphs (DSSG) with de- tailed CO2 emission calculations to support decision-making in disassembly processes. Key objectives include linking DSSG models with carbon footprint calculations to evaluate the environmental impacts of different disassembly scenar- ios. The methodology is applied to a specific case study involving the disassembly of building components, focusing on windows. Findings demonstrate significant variations in carbon emissions based on the selected disassembly direction, underscoring the frameworkâ€™s efficacy in guiding sustainable practices. The study faces challenges such as data gaps in emission factor databases and methodological complexities in scaling to broader applications. This research provides a systematic approach to optimize disassembly processes through DSSG and minimize environmental impact based on a linked methodology of DSSG and LCA. Through accurate carbon footprint calculations, including fasteners and disassembly machines impacts, this leads to well-informed decision-making. Future directions include enhancing data availability, integrating automation tools for improved scalability, and validating the framework through broader case studies in the construction sector.

### How to Use

1. in main.py define target component t
2. run main.py
3. compare environmental impacts and check dssg outputs

This product can only be used for the specific window component and it is already including the matching emission factors.
