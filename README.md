# Disassembly Sequence Structure Graphs (DSSG)

This repository shows a tool created in 2024 for a small-scale university project to calculate the environmental impact (CO2e) for disassembly sequences of window components, based on literature like Smith et al. 2012. The environmental impact calculation is simplified, only to show that it is possible to link DSSG with such calculations and to compare different disassembly sequences based on CO2e emissions.
